- Dimensions: (m×n) × (n×p) = (m×p)
- Non-commutative: AB ≠ BA
- ML connection: Neural network layers = stacked transformations

**Chapters 1-4 Status**: ✅ ALL COMPLETE

- Chapter 1: Vectors
- Chapter 2: Span & Linear Combinations
- Chapter 3: Linear Transformations
- Chapter 4: Matrix Multiplication

### CS50 Python:

- Weeks 0-2: Complete
- Created handwritten summary notes
