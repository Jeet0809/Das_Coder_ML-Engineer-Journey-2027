## 📚 What I Learned Today

### Mathematics:

- **Vectors as mathematical objects**: Arrows, lists, transformations
- **Basis vectors (î, ĵ)**: Building blocks for all vectors
- **Linear combinations**: Scaling and adding vectors
- **Span**: All reachable vectors from combinations
- **ML connection**: Images as high-dimensional vectors (784D for MNIST)

### Python:

- **Loops**: while vs for, when to use each
- **Lists**: Creating, accessing, modifying, iterating
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs, iteration gives KEYS
- **List of Dictionaries**: Common data structure pattern
- **String multiplication**: Pythonic way for repetition
- **Nested loops**: For 2D grids and matrices
- **Functions**: Main pattern, scope, return values
- **Best practices**: Pythonic code style

### DSA Strategy:

- **Optimal approach**: Watch Apna College (Java) → Implement in Python
- **Reason**: Best teaching + interview-ready language
- **Benefits**: No duplicate work, direct applicability

### Career:

- **Ireland internships**: €3,000-4,500/month possible
- **Remote USA opportunities**: No visa needed, multiple platforms
- **Requirements**: DSA + Python + Basic ML = Sufficient
- **Timeline**: Apply Jan 2026 for Summer 2026

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Vectors aren't just math** - they're how ML sees all data
2. **Python lists vs NumPy arrays** - right tool for right job
3. **Dictionary iteration** - always gives keys, not values!
4. **Simple > Complex** - string multiplication beats loops for repetition
5. **Learning strategy** - concept understanding > language syntax
6. **Internship reality** - DSA + Python mastery is 80% of requirement

## 🎯 Best Moments

- Understanding image → vector transformation
- Clarity on Dict vs List of Dicts confusion
- Realizing Python-first DSA strategy is optimal
- Discovering remote USA internship opportunities
- Gym session maintaining physical health

## 🐛 Challenges Faced

- Initial confusion about notes folder location (fixed!)
- Dictionary iteration behavior (understood now!)
- Choosing between Java vs Python for DSA (resolved!)
- Balancing learning depth vs breadth (good progress!)

## 📊 Code Highlights

Learned the Pythonic way
def print_column(height):
print("#\n" \* height, end="") # Better than loop!

Dictionary iteration pattern
for key in my_dict:
value = my_dict[key] # Key insight!

List of dictionaries
for student in students: # student = whole dict
print(student["name"]) # Access fields

## 🔗 Resources Used

- 3Blue1Brown: Essence of Linear Algebra (Ep 1-2)
- CS50 Python: Lectures 0-2
- Apna College: DSA overview
- Research: Ireland/USA internship market

## 📈 Statistics

**Hours Today**: 7h 40min ✅ (153% of 5h target!)
**Cumulative**: 7.67 / 1,872 hours
**Progress**: 0.41% complete
**Streak**: Day 1 🔥
**Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## 🔥 Reflection

**What Went Well:**

- Exceeded daily learning target
- High-quality, deep understanding
- Balanced learning with physical health
- Strategic planning for future
- Asked clarifying questions

**What To Improve:**

- Start LeetCode practice earlier
- Implement code while learning (more hands-on)
- Time block planning (did this naturally today)

**Key Takeaway:**
Starting at 3 AM showed serious commitment. Completing 7+ hours while maintaining quality proves this is sustainable. The foundation is set. Day 1 is a template for the next 729 days.
